Run Time:

Randomized -Quicksort has a worst run time of O(n^2) although it is not likely to occur, and so, we go by its average running time
            which is O(nlogn)
Quadratic - Insertion sort, or the quadratic sorting algorithm has a run tim eof O(n^2).

Hybrid - Since insertion sort is implemented, the worst case for Hybrid will be the same as insertion which is O(n^2).

Space Time:
Quicksort implements recursion, so they have O(nlog) for space complexity.

Quadratic sorts take up O(1) space or constant space.

Justification:
I chose to use insertion sort becuse based on the data collected from part one of the project, insertion sort
has a much better average time than selection or bubble sort - bubble sort having the worst average time. Insertion
sort dealt with both small and big arrays better than selection or bubble.
